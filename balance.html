            <h2>Study Spaces</h2>
            <p>The first part of a healthy school/life balance is, of course, <em>school</em>! By utilizing the many study spaces on campus to get your graduate work done, you can more easily separate your academic life from your personal life, making it easier to achieve a healthy school/life balance. Some of our favorite study spots for graduate students include:</p>
            <br>
            <div class = study_spaces_grid>
                <h3><a class = hatcher href = "https://www.lib.umich.edu/locations-and-hours/hatcher-library/"><strong>The Hatcher Graduate Library</strong></a></h3>
                <p>The study carrels on the third, fourth, and fifth floors offer private, quiet studying opportunities. Additionally, the reading room on the second floor has beautiful architecture and serves as another quiet study space.</p>

                <h3><a class = lawlibrary href = "https://michigan.law.umich.edu/law-library"><strong>The Law Library</strong></a></h3>
                <p>Only the reading room is accessible to non-Law students, but this is another study spot with beautiful architecture and space to spread out. But you can't make a peep!</p>

                <h3><a class = rackham href = "https://rackham.umich.edu/rackham-life/study-spaces/"><strong>The Rackham Graduate School</strong></a></h3>
                <p>The Rackham Graduate School has some lesser known study spots, including a reading room and two comfortable lounges, which are also beautiful and great for quiet study time.</p>
